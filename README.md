# ReactJS Exercise
To start, create a code sandbox for a basic React App. Your project should create a component which, on mount (useEffect with empty deps array) fetches 10 users from randomuser.me with the following fields: name, email, picture. When you receive the data, store it (useState) and then render data for the thumbnail picture, first and last name, and email.
